***** Background:
This data is similar to what the SORCE SOLSTICE instrument has available (though it is a small subset of the
wavelength range). This specific data set is a simulation around the Si 2 emission lines (~180nm).

SOLSTICE collects data by looking at the sun. Light enters the aperture, follows the optical path which includes 
a grating, then lands on a photomultiplier tube (pmt) which counts the number of photon events. The position of 
the grating can be changed, which changes the wavelength of light hitting the pmt, which allows for the measurement 
of the solar spectrum. 

The SORCE spacecraft is in an orbit with roughly a ninety minute period. Unfortunately the spacecraft batteries are 
going bad. It cannot maintain the power required to keep the instrument at it's ideal temperature (22 deg C) and 
so the heaters are turned off during eclipse. This has created significant temperature swings. Another unfortunate 
side effect is that the grating position is reset with each orbit and it never returns to the exact fiducial. This 
creates a small grating offset from orbit to orbit which effects the actual grating position from what is being reported.

From orbit to orbit, the spacecraft will execute different experiments, to measure different effects. The included data 
covers about five orbits worth of data, with different experiments on each orbit.

Over this time period, it is reasonable to assume the solar variability for this wavelength range is not measureable by
this detector.

***** Task:
Please calculate the irradiance in watts/m^2 and compare the scan data. Provide plots of your results along with
your code. Specifically plot the region around the two emission lines at ~180nm. What are your thoughts? Use any 
language you are comfortable with.

***** Equations

 * Wavelength (the grating equation) : 
    offset = 239532.38
    stepSize = 2.4237772022101214E-6
    d = 277.77777777777777
    phiGInRads = 0.08503244115716374
    ang1 = (offset - gratingPosition) * stepSize
    wavelength = 2 * d * sin(ang1) * cos(phiGInRads / 2.0) [nm]
 
 * counts/second/area : 
    integrationTime -> convert to seconds from ms
    cr = counts / integrationTime [counts / sec]
    apArea = .01 [cm^2] (aperature area)
    photonsPerSecondPerCm2 = cr / apArea [photons/sec/cm^2]
    
 * watts/meter^2   
    wavelengthInMeters -> convert to meters from nm
    h = 6.62606957E-34 [m2 * kg / s]
    c = 299792458.0 [m/s]
    energyPerPhoton = h * c / wavelengthInMeters
    wattsPerM2 = photonsPerSecondPerCm2 * 1e2 * 1e2 * energyPerPhoton [watts/m^2]
 
 
***** Files
All files are comma separated with a one line header.

  * detectorTemp.txt : in degrees Celsius. It is roughly sampled at 1 second.
  * distanceAndDoppler.txt : These are the corrections used to adjust for the changing
    distance of the spacecraft and it's changing velocity relative to the sun.
  * instrumentTelemetry.txt : Includes grating position and measured detector counts. It is sampled
    proportional to the current integration time. (keep in mind that this is measured counts which
    which could be dependent on other variables)    
  * integrationTime.txt : This is the current set integration time (ms) of the instrument. 
    Assume the value is constant until there is a new value.
  * plans.txt : This file includes the experiment names with start/end times. You can find the 
    time ranges of the plans of interest her. [start, end)
  * referenceSpectrum.txt : This is a reference spectrum with accurate wavelengths. The current
    irradiance measurements will be within 10% of this spectrum.
